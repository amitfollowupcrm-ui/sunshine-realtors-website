# ✅ OAuth Setup Verification

## **✅ What I Can See is Correct:**

1. **Redirect URI is Added:** ✅
   - `https://sunshine-realtors-website.vercel.app/api/auth/google-callback`
   - This matches what we're using in the code!

2. **Client ID Matches:** ✅
   - `728883357446-vpfeok83pfgh75gh9ve27ss2rokrgrhc.apps.googleusercontent.com`
   - This is what we set on Vercel!

3. **Client Secret:** ✅
   - Enabled and saved

4. **Notification Shows:** ✅
   - "OAuth client saved" - meaning the redirect URI was successfully saved!

## **✅ Everything Looks Correct!**

Your Google Cloud Console configuration is **perfect**! The redirect URI is correctly added.

## **🧪 Now Let's Test It:**

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** (Google says changes can take 5 minutes to a few hours, but usually it's faster)

2. **Test Google Login:**
   - Go to: https://sunshine-realtors-website.vercel.app/login
   - Click the **"Google"** button
   - You should be redirected to Google
   - After signing in, you should be redirected back to your app and logged in!

## **⚠️ If It Still Doesn't Work:**

1. **Clear your browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Try in an Incognito/Private window**
3. **Check the browser console** (F12) for any errors
4. **Wait a bit longer** - Google's changes can take up to an hour to propagate

## **🎉 You're All Set!**

The configuration is correct. Try logging in with Google now!
